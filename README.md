# dApp-TodoList

We'll create a client side application for the todo list that will talk directly to the blockchain. We'll use the Ethereum blockchain in this tutorial, which we can access by connecting our client side application to a single Ethereum node. We'll write a smart contract in Solidity that powers the todo list, and we'll deploy it to the Ethereum blockchain. We'll also connect to the blockchain network with our personal account using an Ethereum wallet in order to interact with the todo list application.
